# Lesson 1: MCU I/O Electrical Characteristics

### **Overview**
In Lesson 1 of the MCU I/O and Electrical Characteristics course, you learned about the basic electrical properties and characteristics of microcontroller (MCU) Input/Output (I/O) pins. This lesson focuses on the importance of understanding the electrical behavior of I/O pins, how to interface MCUs with external components, and how to configure and utilize I/O pins effectively in embedded systems.

### **Key Topics Covered**
1. **I/O Pin Configuration**:
   - Understanding the basic concept of I/O pins in MCUs.
   - How I/O pins can be configured as input or output.
   - Importance of setting the correct direction for I/O pins to ensure proper functionality.
   
2. **Electrical Characteristics of I/O Pins**:
   - **Voltage Levels**: The difference between the high (Vcc) and low (Ground) voltage levels used in I/O communication.
   - **Input Voltage Thresholds**: How voltage levels are interpreted as logical HIGH or LOW in different logic families (TTL, CMOS).
   - **Current Sinking and Sourcing**: How I/O pins can source (provide) or sink (absorb) current, and the importance of respecting current limits.
   - **Pull-up and Pull-down Resistors**: Understanding how these resistors work to maintain a known state on unused or floating I/O pins.

3. **GPIO Pin Modes**:
   - **Input Mode**: When an I/O pin is set to input, it can read signals from external devices (e.g., switches, sensors).
   - **Output Mode**: When set to output, the I/O pin drives a voltage (either HIGH or LOW) to external components (e.g., LEDs, motors).
   - **Tri-state Mode**: The I/O pin is in a high-impedance state, effectively disconnecting it from the circuit.
   
4. **Interfacing External Components**:
   - **LEDs**: How to interface LEDs with I/O pins and how to drive them effectively.
   - **Switches**: Interfacing mechanical switches and understanding the need for pull-up or pull-down resistors.
   - **Relays**: Using I/O pins to control relays, and the need for transistors to handle higher currents.

5. **Power Consumption Considerations**:
   - Discussed how different I/O pin configurations affect the power consumption of the MCU, and the importance of managing this in low-power applications.

6. **Protection of I/O Pins**:
   - How to protect I/O pins from over-voltage and current spikes that could damage the MCU.
   - The use of external diodes and resistors to safeguard pins when interfacing with external circuits.

### **Key Concepts and Terminology**
- **I/O Pins**: Digital pins on an MCU used for input or output.
- **High and Low Voltage**: The logic levels used to represent digital 1 (HIGH) and 0 (LOW).
- **Current Sourcing/Sinking**: Refers to the ability of an I/O pin to either provide current to an external load (sourcing) or receive current from an external load (sinking).
- **Tri-state**: A state where the I/O pin neither drives a voltage nor sinks current.
- **Pull-up/Pull-down Resistors**: Resistors used to ensure that an I/O pin reads a stable HIGH or LOW when not actively driven.
- **TTL/CMOS Logic**: Different logic families with distinct voltage and current characteristics.
